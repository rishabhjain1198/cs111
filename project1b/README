Main challenges faced in this project was to understand the 
obscure manual entries and how to actually use the functions.

Checking for success of every single system call was also 
a cumbersome process. 

A huge problem was to understand when to apply the encryption,
and when to output bytes without decryption.

Another problem was to make sure IV's were same across the baord.
A trivial issue was to make sure I used the right encryption module 
in the right place, as it was giving me issues with weird errors.

Making sure that SIGPIPE was caught is also an important 
factor. Handling that properly took some tinkering, because 
I wasn't sure whether the parent process was supposed to 
simply exit about catching it, or should process the exit 
stauts of the child process.
