Main challenges faced in this project was to understand the 
obscure manual entries and how to actually use the functions.

Checking for success of every single system call was also 
a cumbersome process. 

A huge problem was to understand the correct way to send 
EOF to child process, and then subsequently find out that 
the child process is finished with all its I/O. This was 
ultimately done using a combination of POLLHUP and other 
things, for a robust experience. 

Making sure that SIGPIPE was caught is also an important 
factor. Handling that properly took some tinkering, because 
I wasn't sure whether the parent process was supposed to 
simply exit about catching it, or should process the exit 
stauts of the child process.

Most of the testing of this program was done by running various 
BASH commands, while the sanity check test was also a huge help.
It helped me clear up my exit status codes, since they had to be 
processed trivially to separate the signal and the actual status.
