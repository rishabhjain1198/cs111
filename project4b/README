DIFFICULTIES
There is very little documentation about the Beaglebone Green Wireless platform,
and it refuses to work nicely with MacOS. Midway through the project, my Beaglebone 
just stopped working over USB. Hence, I had to borrow my friendâ€™s Beaglebone in order 
to complete the project. Connecting to my Beaglebone turned out to be the hardest part 
of the project by far.
